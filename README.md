# Web-Scraper
I have created a scraper for a website (Simpletire) which scrapes almost 10k+ tires data of 304 brands and store it in each brand folder separately.

First you have to change the path in every file according to your system
Then first you have to run Brands.py file
Then Folders_creation.py file
Then Types.py
Then Data_Scrap.py file and here you have to change the profile name and user_data_dir accordingly.
All set... Wait and Enjoy.
